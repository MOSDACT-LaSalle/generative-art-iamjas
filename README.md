Here in folders are all my sketches. From my Gaudi star, to the experiments I have been doing to get to the final sketch that we have been asked to deliver. It is curious that, as the first task, we were asked to make a Gaudi star because my Master's Final Project will be based on the Catalan modernism (what a cool coincidence). 

In the experimental sketches I have been playing with irregular polygons (as is done in trencad√≠s) and with deformed curves based on natural formations. Also, I've been painting with my live music connecting Ableton and Processing via OSC. 

I still have to think what will be the final sketch...
